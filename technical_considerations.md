## Quick Reference
When starting a new feature or debugging an issue, consult:

- **Development Workflow** - For build and testing approach
- **Architecture Decisions** - For system design rationale and framework usage
- **UI/UX Patterns** - For component implementation and design consistency
- **Content Management** - For content creation and organization patterns
- **Performance & Technical Insights** - For optimization strategies
- **Bug Fixes & Solutions** - To avoid previously encountered issues

## Critical Reminders
- Always test with both `npm run dev` AND `npm run preview` due to Astro production differences
- Verify responsive design across device sizes when making UI changes
- Maintain dark theme compatibility for all new components
- Include proper frontmatter for all blog content
- Optimize images before adding to `public/` directory

## Contributing
