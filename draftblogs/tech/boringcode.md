* use boring, limit 'innovation token' choices
* boring is well known how they fail - less unknown unkowns
* tech for its own sake, not at a company...think of bigger problems instead (business problems)


Exmaple from article---
* react because its common 
* postgres - solid choice - focus on well-indexed tables to avoid elasticsearch
* golang - simple syntax, error handling easy - requires explicit handling, compiles quickly, compiles to machine code or standalone executable files, dont need VM
* couple innovation tokens - different design, new tool etc..
    - gRPC - interfaces specififed in code, becuase its binary harder to just postman/curl the system, code generation complicated
