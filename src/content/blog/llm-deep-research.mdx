## Average ROI for Home Renovations in the U.S.  
Home remodeling projects generally **do not pay for themselves fully** at resale. Nationally, the average renovation returns only about **60–70%** of its cost in added home value. In other words, most renovations **cost more than they add in value**, so homeowners typically recoup only a portion of what they spend. The exact ROI can swing with market conditions – for instance, during a recent market cooldown, overall resale returns hit record lows (one analysis showed an average cost-to-value ratio of just ~35% in 2023). Conversely, in hotter markets or years, ROI averages have trended higher (e.g. a **5.2% jump in average ROI** from 2023 to 2024 as the housing market rebounded). The key takeaway is that *only a few select projects approach or exceed a 100% return*, while the majority of home improvements will come in under that breakeven mark.

## Top Home Improvement Projects for ROI (National Average)  
Data from recent Cost vs. Value reports reveals that **small curb appeal upgrades yield the highest ROI** for homeowners. In 2024, the top remodeling projects by return on investment were all exterior improvements:

- **Garage door replacement – ~194% ROI:** Replacing an outdated garage door costs relatively little but **recoups nearly **double**** its cost on average at resale. (This jumped dramatically from ~103% the year prior.)  
- **Steel entry door replacement – ~188% ROI:** Installing a new front door (steel) also **nearly doubles your money**. A stylish, secure entry boosts curb appeal and buyer confidence.  
- **Manufactured stone veneer – ~153% ROI:** Adding a stone veneer accent to the front of a house returns over 150% of its cost, transforming the exterior’s look and elevating perceived value.  
- **Minor kitchen remodel (mid-range) – ~96% ROI:** A modest kitchen update (new countertops, cabinet refacing, fixtures, etc.) is the **highest ROI interior project**. Buyers place a premium on an updated kitchen, so a cost-conscious facelift can **nearly pay for itself** when you sell.  

Aside from those top four, other projects with above-average ROI include **fiber-cement siding replacement (~88% ROI)** and **wood deck addition (~83%)**, which enhance curb appeal and functional outdoor space. Even basic improvements like **fresh paint, repairing flooring, or updating light fixtures** can be **cost-effective ways to boost buyer appeal**. Realtors note that projects adding usable square footage in a cost-efficient way – for example, finishing a basement or converting an attic – tend to **yield strong returns** as well by increasing a home’s livable area. (In fact, a basement conversion to living space was estimated to recoup about **86%** of its cost in one national survey.)

## Projects That Typically **Don’t** Pay Off  
On the other end of the spectrum, many **big-ticket renovations have much lower ROI** – meaning they **cost far more than the value they add**. Upscale, luxury, or highly personalized projects rarely come close to breaking even at resale. For example, a **major kitchen remodel** (down-to-the-studs renovation) might only recoup ~**50%** of its price tag, and an **upscale kitchen overhaul** returns even less (~38%). **Bathroom additions and primary suite expansions** are among the lowest ROI projects – a new master suite addition can recover as little as **24–36%** of its cost on average. Even a mid-range bathroom remodel (in an existing space) only yields around **60–70%** ROI in most markets. The Cost vs. Value 2024 data shows **roof replacements, window upgrades, and HVAC system overhauls** generally in the ~50–70% ROI range as well.

In short, **large-scale or luxury renovations tend to **net a financial loss** on resale – you do them primarily for your own enjoyment, not for profit. Homeowners should think twice about over-improving beyond neighborhood norms, since buyers **won’t necessarily pay extra** for features that are considered above and beyond market expectations. If your goal is maximizing resale value, be mindful that “dream home” projects (spa-like bathrooms, gourmet chef’s kitchens, elaborate additions) likely **won’t give a good return** in pure dollar terms.

## Regional Variations in Remodeling ROI  
**Where your home is located can dramatically affect renovation ROI.** Remodeling ROI is not one-size-fits-all across the U.S. – it varies with regional real estate markets and local buyer preferences. In fact, the Cost vs. Value report reveals some projects have **extreme ROI differences by region**. For example, in the **Pacific states** (West Coast), many improvements yield higher returns than the national average, whereas the same upgrades in the Midwest or South may fetch less added value. One striking example: a simple **entry door replacement** was estimated to recoup nearly **90%** of its cost in the Pacific region but only about **40–50%** of its cost in some Northeastern markets. 

Likewise, *overall* remodeling payback tends to be highest in high-cost coastal areas – for several years the **New England and Pacific regions have led the nation in average ROI**, whereas regions like the East North Central (Upper Midwest) and East South Central (Deep South) tend to **lag behind**. These disparities are driven by differences in labor/material costs and what buyers in each market are willing to pay. The key insight is that homeowners should **research local data** in addition to national averages. An improvement that’s a home run in one region could be a flop elsewhere. Consulting with local real estate professionals can help you understand which specific upgrades have the **best payoff in your area**.

## Expert Tips to Maximize Resale Value  
**Prioritize projects that offer the most bang for your buck**. Real estate and remodeling experts consistently advise focusing on high-ROI improvements – especially those that enhance **curb appeal and core living spaces** – when your goal is boosting resale value. Here are some data-driven recommendations:

- **Focus on the first impression:** Simple exterior updates like a new garage door, fresh front door, updated siding or paint, and well-kept landscaping can dramatically improve a buyer’s first impression. *“Curb appeal projects often outperform indoor projects in ROI because they directly impact a buyer’s first impression,”* one real estate expert notes. 
- **Refresh the kitchen (cost-effectively):** You don’t need a lavish kitchen overhaul – in fact, that often backfires on ROI. Instead, consider a **minor kitchen remodel**: update cabinet fronts, countertops, appliances, and fixtures without changing the layout. This kind of facelift yields the **highest return of any interior project (around 90–100% ROI)** because the kitchen is so important to buyers. 
- **Address necessary repairs and maintenance:** While basic maintenance projects (roof repair, old HVAC or plumbing fixes) might not show a high ROI percentage in reports, **not doing them can hurt your home’s value** and curb appeal. A new buyer will discount their offer (or avoid the home) if big-ticket maintenance items are looming.
- **Upgrade wisely, in line with your market:** If you’re going to invest in improvements, choose ones that **match your home’s value range and neighborhood**. Adding an extra bedroom or finishing a basement can be smart if your home is lacking those compared to local comps.

Finally, remember that **ROI isn’t everything** – your own enjoyment of the home matters too. The smartest approach is to **plan renovations with both personal value *and* resale value in mind**. By prioritizing the right projects – and not overpaying for those with low return – homeowners can significantly **boost their home’s resale value** and attract buyers, without breaking the bank.
