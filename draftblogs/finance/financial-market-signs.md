* Utilities are safer but can lag the broader market
    * Show investments in AI, defense industry - power hungry GPUs
    * risks for power companies can be weather events like wildfires
* Industry - companies that make nuts/bolts - quick to report quarterly earnings - tells you industrial investment
* Transportation - indicator of consumer spending and manufacturing spending 
* Banks like JPMorgan Chase that file early in the quarter - business loan activity
* Computer chips but also companies that make the machines that make computer chips
* Credit card companies - mastercard and VISA - consumer spending is 2/3 of GDP, how much are people spending without defaulting
* The well-diversified company - used to be GE, now Microsoft - datacenters require buildings which requires concrete....ripple effect of lots of industry health indicators
