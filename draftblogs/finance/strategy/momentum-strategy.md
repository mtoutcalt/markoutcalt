### Choosing based on momentum
* stocks in upswing will continue driven by FOMO
* stocks in downswing will continue driven by panic and margin calls
    * margin-call -- when a borrowed stock needs to be sold or more cash given to cover loss
* more similar to growth stock, can go opposite of value stock

* ETFs and funds that buy/sell based on momentum
    * usually do better during bear and worse during bull - more extreme
    * can lag - so Nvidia after 2023 gets dropped then miss out on gains during 2024
    * criteria
        * price history momentum
            * look at recent or ignore recent and look at medium term momentum trend
        * earnings momentum - quarters up or down in sequence
        * some funds may also look for P/S no higher than 1.5
        * choose based on relative outperformers/underperformers
    * holding an ETF long vs. buying/selling lots of stocks to chase momentum can reduce taxable gains
