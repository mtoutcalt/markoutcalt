After over a decade of working, these are the behaviors and programmer memes that I refer to all the time.

### 8. Gold-Plating

<u>Requirements gold-plating</u>: Some projects have more requirements than they need right from the beginning. Performance is stated as a requirement more often than it needs to be, and that can unnecessarily lengthen a software schedule. Users tend to be less interested in complex features than marketing and development are, and complex features add disproportionately to a development schedule.

<u>Developer gold-plating</u>: Developers are fascinated by new technology and are sometimes anxious to try out new features of their language or environment or to create their own implementation of a slick feature they saw in another product – whether or not it’s required in their product. The effort required to design, implement, test, document, and support features that are not required lengthens the schedule.
