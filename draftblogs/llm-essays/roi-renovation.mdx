# Do Nearly All Home Renovation Projects for Indoor Rooms Lose Money or Have a Negative ROI?

## Executive Summary

This report examines whether most indoor home renovation projects result in negative returns on investment (ROI). Based on comprehensive research from multiple industry sources including the National Association of Realtors (NAR), Remodeling Magazine's Cost vs. Value Report, and other real estate and renovation industry data, we found that while most indoor renovation projects do not recoup 100% of costs, they do not universally have negative ROI. The analysis reveals significant variations in returns based on project type, scope, region, and market conditions.

## Key Findings

1. **Most indoor renovation projects recover 50-80% of costs**, with only select projects exceeding 100% ROI.
2. **Exterior projects consistently outperform interior renovations** in terms of ROI.
3. **Minor renovations typically yield better returns** than major overhauls in the same rooms.
4. **Regional markets significantly impact** potential renovation returns.
5. **Non-financial benefits ("Joy Score")** often justify renovation expenses beyond pure financial return.

## Analysis of Indoor Renovation ROI

### The 70% Rule of Thumb

Industry experts consistently cite an average 70% ROI for home renovation projects overall. According to RenoFi, "The rule of thumb that we share with homeowners is that you can expect a 70% ROI, on average, with home renovation projects" (RenoFi, 2024). This means that for every $1,000 spent on renovations, homeowners typically recoup about $700 in home value.

### ROI by Indoor Room Type

#### Kitchen Renovations

Kitchen renovations remain among the highest-returning indoor projects:

- **Minor kitchen remodels**: According to the 2024 Cost vs. Value Report, a minor kitchen remodel has a 96.1% ROI, positioning it as the leading indoor project for increasing home value (Fixr, 2024).
- **Major kitchen remodels**: Returns diminish significantly for major kitchen overhauls, with upscale kitchen renovations returning only 38-60% of costs (Bankrate, 2024).

National Association of Realtors data shows kitchens remain the most renovated rooms (29%) because they're central to home function and buyer interest (MCOB News, 2024).

#### Bathroom Renovations

Bathroom renovations show mixed ROI performance:

- **Mid-range bathroom renovations**: Typically return around 74% of costs (Bankrate, 2024).
- **Upscale bathroom renovations**: According to Today's Homeowner, "the worst-ranking project is an upscale bathroom remodel" with homeowners recouping "less than half their upfront investment" (Today's Homeowner, 2023).
- **Universal Design bathrooms**: A specialized accessibility-focused bathroom redesign returns about 51% of costs in some regions (CustomCraftDBR, 2024).

#### Flooring Projects

Hardwood flooring consistently delivers strong returns:

- **Refinishing existing hardwood floors**: 147% ROI according to NAR's 2022 Remodeling Impact Report (Bankrate, 2024).
- **Installing new hardwood floors**: 118% ROI according to the same report.

These represent rare indoor projects that consistently deliver positive returns exceeding the initial investment.

#### Basement Finishing

According to Today's Homeowner (2023), finished basements have among the lowest ROI of major renovation projects at just 22.7%. However, the Portland Real Estate blog notes that basement renovations can deliver higher ROI when focused on creating functional living space rather than specialized rooms.

### Factors Affecting Indoor Renovation ROI

#### 1. Renovation Scale and Cost

A consistent finding across reports is that minor, cost-effective renovations typically outperform major overhauls in the same room:

- NAR's deputy chief economist, Jessica Lautz, notes, "While homeowners take pride in seeing their personal tastes and design choices come to life, Realtors may recommend different strategies to enhance the property's resale value" (Real Estate News, 2025).
- The higher cost of deluxe renovations is often not supported by comparable market values, particularly in mid-range homes (Today's Homeowner, 2023).

#### 2. Regional Market Differences

ROI varies significantly by geographic region:

- The 2024 Cost vs. Value report shows dramatic regional variations in returns.
- The Pacific (Western US) and New England regions consistently show higher renovation returns than other regions.
- According to the report, location-specific factors can cause the same renovation to have dramatically different ROI values across markets.

#### 3. Market Conditions

Current real estate market conditions heavily influence renovation returns:

- Seller's markets typically yield higher renovation ROIs.
- In buyer's markets, renovations may need to be more selective and targeted.
- Current higher mortgage rates create unique conditions where exterior curb appeal investments show exceptional returns.

## Why Indoor Renovations May Underperform

Research identifies several reasons why indoor renovations typically return less than their cost:

1. **Personalization penalty**: Highly personalized renovations may appeal less to broad buyer pools.
2. **Overimprovement risk**: Upgrades beyond neighborhood norms aren't fully valued in appraisals.
3. **Style obsolescence**: Design trends change rapidly, potentially dating renovations by sale time.
4. **Competitive context**: In buyer's markets, renovations may need to be more extensive to stand out.

According to the National Association of the Remodeling Industry (NARI) data, most homeowners renovate for personal benefit rather than resale value. Only 4% of homeowners cited "improving a home's quality for eventual resale" as their primary motivation (Real Estate News, 2025).

## Beyond Financial ROI: The "Joy Score"

The National Association of Realtors calculates a "Joy Score" (1-10) for renovation projects based on homeowner satisfaction:

- Many indoor renovations score highly on this metric despite modest financial returns.
- Kitchen and bathroom renovations typically receive highest "joy scores" despite not delivering the highest financial ROI.
- As NAR's Jessica Lautz notes, "While most of us spend a great deal of time in the kitchen...the kitchen-related project does not bring the highest return on value or the highest Joy Score" (NAR Research Spotlight, 2022).

## Exceptions: Indoor Renovations with Positive ROI

Not all indoor renovations lose money. Several consistently deliver returns near or exceeding 100%:

1. **Hardwood flooring installation and refinishing**: 118-147% ROI
2. **Insulation upgrades**: 100% ROI, with additional energy savings
3. **Minor kitchen remodels**: 96% ROI, close to break-even
4. **Interior painting**: When done by homeowner, can exceed 100% ROI

## Conclusion: Do Indoor Renovations Lose Money?

The research does not support the sweeping claim that "nearly all" indoor renovation projects lose money or have negative ROI. While most indoor renovations do not fully recoup their costs at resale (averaging 50-80% returns), this represents a partial rather than total loss.

The financial ROI tells only part of the renovation value story. Most homeowners renovate primarily for improved living quality rather than financial return, with NAR data showing only 18% of renovations are motivated by plans to sell within two years.

For homeowners planning to remain in their homes for years after renovations, the combination of partial cost recovery and enhanced living enjoyment often justifies the investment, even without 100% financial returns.

## Recommendations for Maximizing Indoor Renovation ROI

For those seeking to optimize financial returns on indoor renovations:

1. **Focus on minor, cost-effective updates** rather than major overhauls
2. **Prioritize kitchens and bathrooms** with broad appeal and neutral finishes
3. **Consider hardwood flooring** as it consistently delivers strong returns
4. **Avoid overimprovement** relative to neighborhood norms
5. **Research region-specific returns** using local Cost vs. Value data
6. **Time renovations strategically** based on market conditions
7. **Balance financial returns with personal enjoyment** for best overall value
