* combined ratio - losess + expenses / premiums 
    * combined ration of 100% means the premiums coming in exactly matched the cost of business
    * because insurance companies are investing cash, they can still make profits when combined ratios are 100% or above (to a limit)
    * this investable money they don't technically own but can invest and make profits from is called the 'float' - 
* people often HAVE to buy insurance - home insurance, renters insurance, auto insurance, health insurance....
* strategy
    * insurance companies win by pricing premiums slightly above claims costs - too low and the pay out more than they make, too high and everyone will get insurance from cheaper company
        * insurance companies can use data and A.I. to thread this needle better
        * with crazier weather, that means premiums have to go up, but prices often lag until there's losses realized and historical data to suggest prices must come up for all competitiors
