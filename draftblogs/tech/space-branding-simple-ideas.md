	• Code reviews were a bottleneck - too big, waiting for approvals
	• SPACE framework…..wtf
	• CHANGES
		○ Sonarqube to codacy (only choice)
		○ Slack alerts for PR activity (been doing this since we got slack years ago?) --- showing comments too?  Noisy
		○ SPACE - mindset change - 'hey humans, doing code reviews is important!'
	• PR metrics - how many, size, time, stories completed, static anaylsys like cyclomatic complexity
	• Results
		○ Wellbing survey - happier 15% 
		○ Code quality and throughput - constant
		○ 74% faster PR time 
		○ 56% smaller PR
	• Critical thinking - 'spotlight effect?
		○ Can you show theres actual end goal business value improvement?
		○ Throughput and quality had no registered change?
		○ Timeline was quick - what is the lasting impact?  Reduce slack noise.  Spotlight effect
		○ This is really just coproate BS - self promotion - agenda of evangelizing a branded framework you can put in your performance review - theatrics
	• SPACE 
		○ Wheres the innovation?  The fact that it incorporates feelings of people and data?  You mean treating employees with some humanity, acking that their emotions impact every aspect of their life including work, is a useful datapoint?!
	• Category - triggered?
Corporate life - keep your head down - lose focus when I get caught up - writing this down helps maybe?

* developer productivity with simple metrics has been the status quo - but you need multiple says SPACE
* other measures
	* personal perception - flow or focus time
	* measure well being and psychological metrics of developer (who would've thought?)
* S - satisfaction - well being of the person matters (duh)
* P - performance - needs to be outcome based not output
* A - activity - they are helpful but arent enough - (stories/epics/docs/PRs/lines of code written/deploys etc..)
* C - Communication/collaboration - proxy metrics - docs and ease to find them, work is reviewed, onboarding time
* E - efficiency - give devs more flow - DORA proxy of frequency of commits and deploys -- time to prod and tools not hampering time -- less process overhead and handoffs -- 
* Myths
	* busy does not mean productive
	* team metrics need to be considered too not just solo metrics ex. mentoring, code reviews - invisible work - culture/team bonding matters too

* How to use the framework
	* Get metrics from multiple categories
		* Discuss the tradeoffs - what are the most important goals and which metrics fit that
	* measuring lines of code but not also code review quality and customer satisfaction creates bad incentives
