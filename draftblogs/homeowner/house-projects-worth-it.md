### Projects that are cheap and tactically effective

* Painting - if you're able to do the labor yourself, this often pays off.  Go for neutral colors.
* Lighting fixtures
* Change up the hardware in your kitchen to the latest fad
* 

### Strategy
* You're much better off bringing the worst aspects of your house up to the 'okay' level than taking something at 'okay' and elevating that to good or great
* First impressions with exterior can have outsize pyschological effect
* Landscaping - less and simple is better
* Things that matter will be different depending on the social status level of your house
    * Nicer houses, bigger expectations
    * What kind of people will buy or be able to afford your house?  Young couples buying their first or older adults upgrading to something new?
* If you think you might sell soon, go with the common denominator choice.  If not, get what you love.  Fads change quickly anyways.



### (CVV) Cost Value Report - Zonda data - https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2024/
Only projects with cost fully recouped:
* new garage door
* new steel front door
* manufactured stone veneer

90% or above:
* Grand entrance - nicer door with glass features
* Minor kitchen remodel - midrange - only indoor project above 75% recoup
    * The kitchen must be dated, laminate countertops, replace outdated appliances, leave cabinet boxes in place but replace fronts, new flooring and painting, new sink
    * Major kitchen remodel where you're spending up to $80k is more like 49% recoup - custom cabinets, new island, everything is redone

80% or above:
* Siding replacement - fiber cement - 88% vs. vinyl 80%
* Adding a NEW wooden deck

Bathroom:
Remodel for midrange - 73%
* Data is showing you spend $25k and recoupe $18k so loss of $7k
* replace all fixtures, porcelain tub into ceramix tiled, ceramic tile, new sink and counter, new standard toilet
* Like all these projects, this recoup is assuming youre existing bathroom is noticeably out-dated and dysfunctional

Others:
* Get a heat pump - 66%
* Rpelace windows - 67% for vinyl and 62% for wood
* New roof - asphalt shingles - 56%


Regional Differences:
* Mostly the same as nationwide
* New England - kitchen remodel goes up to 110% - is that becuase lots of old houses with outdated kitchens?
* Siding replacement - fiber cement has 3% higher but even vinyl siding goes from 80% national to 115% regional - harsh winters, have simple and durable siding - lots of old wooden houses
    * siding has lower recoup in the south which gives evidence to my theory
* garage door replacement - 314% regional!


Summary:
* In almost every case, indoor renovation projects will not make you money
    * exceptions - your current room needs to be in bad shape, severly outdated for this to be true, and the evergreen advice of kitchen and bathrooms being the most effective is true
    * You're better off being tactical.  Update applicances.  Neurtral colors.  New paint job.  Keep your cabinets and update hardware or paint job.  New faucet.
* outdoor projects, first impressions, specifically in the front, can make a huge difference
* If you have an old garage door, get a new one now
    * wood to fiberglass with windows
* If you don't have a wooden deck or patio in your backyard and you have the space, it's probably worth it
* Regional matters a little, mostly for outdoor projects, weather and culture (how old are houses) can mean hardy weather in the north having nicer siding, garage doors, front doors can make huge difference
* Replacing the bottom third of your front siding with manufactured stone veneer can pay off
* Keep in mind the energy savings with upgrades like better garages, front doors, siding, heat pumps.  Also government rebates.
