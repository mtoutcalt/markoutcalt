I am spending a lot of my time reading articles about AI.  Many of them I find to be ridiculous.  I especially love when there's actually a falsifiable prediction, and I look forward to seeing how often these are wrong.

I will update this list as I encounter more.

**Summary**: This article has a lot of juicy falsifiable predictions.  The source has the appearance of being very serious and legit.  According to this, basically by 2030 AI will take over every job, 
and 2027 is when things REALLY change drastically. I felt very depressed after reading it, and honestly that made me extra bothered.

- **Mid 2025**: 
  - Research agents spend half an hour scouring the Internet to answer your question
- **Late 2026**: 
  - The stock market has gone up 30% in 2026, led by OpenBrain, Nvidia, and whichever companies have most successfully integrated AI assistants
  - The job market for junior software engineers is in turmoil: the AIs can do everything taught by a CS degree, but people who know how to manage and quality-control teams of AIs are making a killing
- **July 2027**: 
  - Gamers get amazing dialogue with lifelike characters in polished video games that took only a month to make
  - OpenBrain announces that they've achieved AGI and releases Agent-3-mini to the public
  - Hiring new programmers has nearly stopped
- **August 2027**: 
  - The government placates the public with job training programs and unemployment insurance, and point to the stock market, which is in a historic boom

- **December 2027**:
  - An AI system that is much better than the best human at every cognitive task. The new AI assistant is both *extremely* useful for any task—the equivalent of the best employee anyone has ever had working at 100x speed—and a *much* more engaging conversation partner than any human
- **Mid 2028**: 
  - GDP growth is stratospheric. Government tax revenues are growing equally quickly
  - Agent-5-advised politicians show an uncharacteristic generosity towards the economically dispossessed
