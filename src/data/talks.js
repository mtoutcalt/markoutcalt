    summary: "You remember when software doesn't work but get used to the magic when it works. Sometimes non digital - like card board stamp for free drink - works better than app that doesn't work with very small screen. Deterministic outputs, but inputs are chaotic from real life. History of AI or intelligence showing how it peaks then hits plateau despite hype.",

Local models got much better. Claude 3.7 - much better result. GPT 4.5 price went way up. 'bugs' - sycophantic, emailing gov if you do something bad.

    summary: "Shipley's six dimensions - brevity of code, featurefulness, speed of execution, time spent coding, robustness, flexibility --- these are tradeoffs. First law of ecology - you can't change just one thing. Theorem of software - solve any problem with more indirection (except more indirection). Conway's law - org structure effects results. McLuhan's law - the tools we use shape us. Goodhart's law - when a metric becomes a target it becomes a worse measure. House's law - the metrics that are the hardest to measure are often the most valuable. Hick's law - more options you have slows down decision making. Cunningham's law - fastest way to get feedback is to publicly submit a flawed answer. Diminishing returns - point when cost exceeds value added.",

    summary: "AI summers and winters since the 1950s. Connectionism - Turing's projections of intelligence. Symbolism - tiny mental models - build human brain with these small rules. Cybernetics - intelligence through goals and feedback loops - Norbert Weiner. A.I. 'summer' a summer workshop with John McCarthy - term A.I. was a marketing term in the 50's. Perceptron - connectionism - first neural network - single layer networks - couldn't generalize - Minsky switched to Symbolism. Second AI summer - 80's - LISP helped the symbolists - first AI language. Expert systems - 'knowledge engineers' - why is there always a BS title for AI engineers. 1983 - 'AGI is around the corner' - 'jobs will be replaced' - expert systems will replace people. By 1987- expert systems were showing limitations - and expensive -- these predictions are really just SQL statements - too much human context that couldn't be captured into these systems. Unix workstations overshadowed LISP machines. First AI summer - underestimating problem space. Second AI summer- focus on specialization. Our current third AI summer - get generalization capabilities through scale. A USA A.I system beating the world's best GO player made China pivot and invest - more geopolitical races - earlier was Soviets with 2nd AI summer.",
