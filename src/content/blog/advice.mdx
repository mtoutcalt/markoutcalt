import { advice } from '../../data/advice.js';


<p style={{ marginBottom: '4rem' }}>I read a lot of articles and over time I encounter advice lists.  Here is a place to consolidate them.  This list is intended to be a personal, curated list of things that resonate with me and hopefully with you too. </p>

{advice.map(({ content, source }) => (
    <div style={{ marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
        <blockquote>
            {content}
            <footer style={{ fontSize: '18px' }}>â€” <a href={source} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">{source}</a></footer>
        </blockquote>
    </div>
))}
