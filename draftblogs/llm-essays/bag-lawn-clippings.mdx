# To Bag or Not to Bag: The Benefits of Leaving Grass Clippings on Your Lawn

## Executive Summary

This report examines the question: "In the U.S., when we mow our lawns, is it better to have the mower collect and bag all the trimmings or is it better to cut the grass and leave everything on the lawn?" Based on extensive research from university studies, agricultural extensions, and environmental agencies, the evidence strongly supports leaving grass clippings on the lawn—a practice often called "grasscycling." This approach provides significant benefits for lawn health, environmental sustainability, and homeowner convenience.

## Introduction

Lawn maintenance practices vary widely across the United States, with some homeowners religiously bagging their grass clippings while others leave them in place. This report examines the scientific evidence behind both approaches to determine which practice is more beneficial overall. The findings draw on research from agricultural universities, extension services, environmental agencies, and lawn care professionals.

## Benefits of Leaving Grass Clippings on the Lawn

### 1. Nutrient Cycling

One of the most significant benefits of leaving grass clippings on your lawn is the return of valuable nutrients to the soil:

- **Natural Fertilization**: According to the University of Minnesota Extension, grass clippings are "a valuable source of nutrients and you can use less nitrogen fertilizer if you recycle clippings to the lawn" (University of Minnesota Extension, 2025).

- **Nitrogen Contribution**: Research from Earth Smart Solutions (2022) indicates that grass clippings "contain 4% nitrogen, 2% potassium, and 1% phosphorus along with small amounts of other plant nutrients." This nutrient profile makes them an excellent natural fertilizer source.

- **Reduced Fertilizer Needs**: Oregon State University research by turfgrass specialist Alec Kowalewski (2003) found that "we can cut the fertilizer application rate almost in half when we return clippings with a mulching type rotary mower," and "on lawns growing in clay soils, I have produced acceptable quality turf for as long as 12 years without adding any fertilizer at all."

- **Scientific Research**: A study published in Science of The Total Environment demonstrated that "returning grass clippings is equivalent to doubling the amount of N applied" through fertilization (Ciarlo et al., 2022). This peer-reviewed research demonstrates the substantial fertilization value of grass clippings.

### 2. Environmental Benefits

Leaving grass clippings on the lawn provides several environmental advantages:

- **Reduced Landfill Waste**: According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (2025), "Yard trimmings make up a big portion of your total municipal solid waste — averaging at about 12% nationwide." This equates to over 35 million tons annually. Keeping grass clippings out of landfills significantly reduces this waste stream.

- **Methane Reduction**: The EPA (2025) notes that "municipal solid waste landfills are the third largest source of human-related methane emissions in the U.S., accounting for approximately 14% of methane emissions in 2022." Organic materials like grass clippings contribute to this methane production when placed in landfills.

- **Water Conservation**: Research published in Science of The Total Environment found that "soil volumetric water content is 4% higher, on average, when clippings are returned" (Ciarlo et al., 2022). This moisture retention reduces irrigation needs, particularly during summer months.

- **Carbon Sequestration**: Lawn Starter (2025) notes that grass clippings contribute organic matter to the soil, helping to sequester carbon and improve overall soil health.

### 3. Soil Health Improvement

- **Organic Matter Addition**: The University of Minnesota Extension (2025) states that "adding organic matter from clippings may help improve your soil if it is sandy, heavy clay or low in organic matter."

- **Microbial Activity**: According to The Spruce (2024), when grass clippings decompose, they "serve as a food source for microbial life in the soil," enhancing the soil ecosystem.

- **Reduced Compaction**: Scientific Plant Service (2022) notes that clippings help maintain soil structure and reduce compaction, which improves root growth and water infiltration.

### 4. Practical Benefits

- **Time and Labor Savings**: Hutson Inc. (2024) points out one clear benefit: "Less work - raking, bagging, and handling the clippings can take a lot of time and effort. Letting the lawn naturally decompose clippings is much easier."

- **Cost Savings**: Lawn Doctor (2024) highlights multiple economic benefits including "reduced fertilizer needs, fewer trash bags, and potentially lower waste disposal fees" which contribute to cost savings for homeowners.

## Common Misconceptions

### Thatch Buildup

One of the most persistent myths about leaving grass clippings on lawns is that it contributes to thatch buildup. However, research consistently refutes this claim:

The University of Minnesota Extension (2025) states explicitly: "Contrary to popular belief, leaving clippings on the lawn does not contribute to increased thatch." 

Similarly, the University of Missouri Extension confirms that "grass clippings contain 80 to 85 percent water and decompose much more quickly than other grass plant parts" and that "research at MU and other universities indicates that clippings do not contribute to thatch buildup on any cool- or warm-season grasses."

Oregon State University researcher Alec Kowalewski (2003) affirms that "virtually all research conducted with turf has shown that grass clippings do not increase thatch."

### Appearance Concerns

Some homeowners avoid leaving clippings because they worry about the appearance of their lawn. However, with proper mowing practices, this concern can be minimized:

- **Mowing Frequency**: Oregon State University's Kowalewski (2003) recommends that "frequent mowing, about once a week during the growing season, will have a greater impact on turf quality than any other lawn care practice except irrigation in the summer."

- **Mowing Height**: Scotts (2024) recommends following the "one-third rule—never removing more than 1/3 the length of the grass blades" to ensure clippings are small enough to decompose quickly and not remain visible.

- **Mulching Mowers**: As noted by Hutson Inc. (2024), "mulching mowers are designed to cut grass into finer pieces, which can decompose more quickly and provide more nutrients to the lawn."

## When Bagging May Be Appropriate

While leaving grass clippings is generally beneficial, there are specific situations when bagging might be the better option:

1. **Disease Management**: The University of Minnesota Extension (2025) recommends: "Remove clippings if the lawn is heavily infested with diseases such as leaf spot, rust or dollar spot to help reduce disease severity."

2. **Excessive Growth**: Lawn Doctor (2024) advises that "if the lawn is wet or the grass has become too tall when you mow, clippings can mat together and smother the grass," making collection advisable.

3. **Wet Conditions**: Be Green Pro (2024) cautions that "wet grass clippings can mat down and suffocate your lawn," making bagging a better option when mowing damp grass.

4. **Aesthetic Preferences**: Lawn Love (2023) acknowledges that "if you like your lawn to have a traditional, even-looking appearance, then mulching might not be for you" as some homeowners prefer the manicured look of a freshly bagged lawn.

## Best Practices for Grasscycling

To maximize the benefits of leaving grass clippings on your lawn:

1. **Maintain Sharp Blades**: Scientific Plant Service (2022) advises to "be sure the mower blade is sharp and cuts, not tears, your grass" as this helps clippings decompose more efficiently.

2. **Mow Regularly**: Oregon State University's Kowalewski (2003) recommends frequent mowing: "about once a week during the growing season" for best results.

3. **Follow the One-Third Rule**: Scotts (2024) and multiple extension services emphasize never removing more than one-third of the grass height in a single mowing.

4. **Mow When Dry**: The Spruce (2024) advises to "avoid mowing when grass is wet" to prevent clumping and uneven distribution of clippings.

5. **Consider a Mulching Mower**: Hutson Inc. (2024) notes that "most mowers should be capable of mulching" and these specialized mowers "cut grass into finer pieces, which can decompose more quickly."

## Environmental Impact of Grass Clippings in Landfills

When grass clippings are bagged and sent to landfills, they contribute to significant environmental problems:

- **Methane Production**: According to the EPA (2021), "landfills are among the nation's largest sources of methane, a greenhouse gas far more potent than carbon dioxide." NPR reporting (2021) notes that "landfills emit methane when organic wastes such as food scraps, wood and paper decompose."

- **Resource Waste**: The EPA (2025) states that "when we send food and other organic materials to landfills or combustion facilities, we throw away valuable nutrients and carbon contained in those materials."

- **Decomposition Rates**: BioCycle (2024) indicates that grass clippings have a decay constant of 0.39, making them "half gone in 1.8 years" in landfill conditions. This relatively rapid decomposition results in significant methane release before gas collection systems are typically operational.

## Scientific Research on Grass Clippings

Multiple university studies support the benefits of returning grass clippings to lawns:

1. **University of Minnesota Extension** (2025): Their research confirms that grass clippings do not contribute to thatch and provide valuable nutrients when left on lawns.

2. **Oregon State University** (2003): Studies by turfgrass specialist Alec Kowalewski show that returning clippings can reduce fertilizer needs by up to 50%.

3. **Science of The Total Environment Study** (2022): Research published by Ciarlo, Dubois, and Guagnozzi found that "returning grass clippings is equivalent to doubling the amount of nitrogen applied through fertilization, and increases soil volumetric water content by approximately 4%."

4. **University of Missouri Extension**: Their research confirms that grass clippings contain 80-85% water and decompose much more quickly than other grass plant parts, not contributing to thatch buildup.

5. **Colorado State University** (reported via LawnSite forum, 2022): Research led by Yaling Qian found that "if lawn clippings are left on grass after it is mowed, nitrogen and carbon, two nutrients important to plants, increase within the soil."

## Conclusion

Based on extensive scientific research and expert recommendations, leaving grass clippings on the lawn is the better practice for most homeowners under normal conditions. This approach provides significant benefits including:

- Natural fertilization and nutrient cycling
- Improved soil health and moisture retention
- Environmental benefits through reduced landfill waste and decreased methane emissions
- Time and cost savings for homeowners

While specific situations may warrant bagging (disease management, excessive growth, or wet conditions), the general practice of "grasscycling" is the more sustainable and beneficial approach to lawn maintenance. By following best practices for mowing frequency, height, and equipment maintenance, homeowners can maintain attractive lawns while contributing to environmental sustainability.
